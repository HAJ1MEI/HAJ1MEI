## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sumit Vhatkar, a computer engineering student with a passion for coding. I've been exploring various programming languages, and so far, I'm really enjoying C++, Python, and JavaScript. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of algorithms and data structures, which I find fascinating because theyâ€™re the building blocks of efficient coding.

Right now, Iâ€™m working on a personal project where Iâ€™m building a weather app using Python and integrating it with a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s my first step into full-stack development, and Iâ€™m excited to see how it turns out!
